            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Snakes and Ladders is a classic board game that is fun for people of all ages. The game is simple to learn and play, but can be challenging as you try to avoid the snakes and climb up the ladders to reach the finish line first.</p>
            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <p>The objective of Snakes and Ladders is to be the first player to reach the 100th space on the board. To do this, players must roll a die and move their piece forward the number of spaces indicated on the die. If a player lands on the bottom of a ladder, they can move up to the top of the ladder. If a player lands on the head of a snake, they must slide down to the bottom of the snake.</p>
            <h1>Setup</h1>
            <p>To set up Snakes and Ladders, you will need a game board, a die, and one playing piece for each player. The game board is typically square and has 100 numbered spaces. The snakes and ladders are drawn on the board, with the snakes leading down to lower spaces and the ladders leading up to higher spaces.</p>
            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
            <p>To begin the game, each player places their playing piece on the start space (space number 1). The youngest player rolls the die first. On your turn, roll the die and move your piece forward the number of spaces indicated on the die. If you land on the bottom of a ladder, move up to the top of the ladder. If you land on the head of a snake, slide down to the bottom of the snake.
                If you land on a space that is already occupied by another player's piece, your piece simply goes on top of the other player's piece. You can still move up a ladder or down a snake, even if there is another player's piece on the space.
                The first player to reach the 100th space on the board wins the game.</p>
